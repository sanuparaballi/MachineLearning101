# MachineLearning101
This repository is a collection of my 'this-and-that' on machine learning. 

Disclaimer:
  Not all the code the you see here is from me. Few of the code, code-snippets might be borrowed from their original authors from internet. Albeit, they are all publically available.
  This repository is to work and check on how things work on Machine Learning. So, you are free to use the code and imporve or add to it.
  If you have objections to any of the materials, please refrain from making it public because this is just a 'learning' exercise for Machine Learning.
